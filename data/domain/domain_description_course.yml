  - text: "The Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics program is a 
    4-year undergraduate degree program that provides graduates with the 
    ability to identify, formulate, model, and analyze real-world problems 
    and find their solutions using operations research techniques, geospatial tools, 
    and statistical methods. It also provides competencies in the decision-making analysis, 
    optimization, mathematical modeling and simulation, and the ability to implement and 
    develop computer programs to facilitate complex computations."

  - text: "The BS Biology program is a 4-year degree program with 147 units. The program offers a 
    learning experience that encompasses the theoretical, quantitative, and applied aspects 
    of the biological sciences. The strong foundation courses, the intensive practical 
    laboratory and field experiences, and elective courses prepare the students 
    for careers in scientific research, medicine, education, policy-making, 
    environmental management, and several related fields in the country and 
    the world. The graduates of the program will acquire critical thinking, 
    social accountability, ethical judgment, equity, and openness for continuing professional development.<br><br>

    The curriculum includes the conduct of undergraduate thesis which provides 
    the students the opportunity to perform research work along with their chosen 
    field of specialization under the guidance of their selected faculty adviser."

  - text: "BS Food Technology is a 4-year program 
    that seeks to train students to be the prime movers 
    of the food industry. The program focuses on providing students with appropriate 
    knowledge, skills, and technique of the foundation courses of 
    food technology in the interest of developing new food products, 
    processes, and innovative food systems. Ultimately, graduates will 
    be equipped with holistic understanding of food science and other 
    disciplines to: ensure food safety and security, be able to define
    problems related to food systems, identify potential causes and solutions, 
    and make innovative decisions and recommendations, demonstrate skills in 
    the evaluation and advocacy of food-related policies, and develop socially, 
    culturally, and environmentally related food systems that promote equity and sustainability."

  utter_description_BSDS:
  - text: "Data science is an interdisciplinary subject at 
    the crossroads of mathematics, computer science,
    and domain expertise. The bachelor’s degree program envisions 
    producing highly competent data analysis practitioners and problem
      solvers, possessing entrepreneurial mindsets. These graduates 
      will be problem solvers in various fields using applications of data 
      science. With this, the program should reflect the interdisciplinary
      nature of this field with emphasis on techniques, concepts and 
      problem-solving processes. Moreover, students are expected to have a 
      healthy mix of mathematics, computer science, and business courses to take."

  - text: "As UP Mindanao is envisioned to grow into a comprehensive University, its academic programs
    shall put emphasis on science, technology, agriculture, and medicine so that it can assist the region
      in the process of nation building.<br><br>

    As new global issues emerge, the food industry is beset with 
    concerns in waste reduction, food safety, food security, 
    development of new products, and the like. The University 
    believes that the MS Food Science program can assist in building 
    up human resources who are equipped to find solutions to these problems. 
    The Master’s Program is responsive to the needs of the food industry and the academe."
