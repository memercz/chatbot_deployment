      During the midyear term, the normal load is 6 units, but the Dean may permit up to 9 units in certain cases. <br> Additionally, students employed outside the university may have their academic load restricted by the Dean or Director, with full-time graduate students generally limited to 10 units per semester without prior approval.

        <b>Within the University</b><br>
        students need permission from their Dean or Director to register in another college, school, or department. Cross-registration within the University requires filling out a form (UP Form 5B), and the total units must adhere to academic load rules. <br>

        <b> Students from other institutions </b><br> to register at UP, they need written permits from their institution's Dean, Director, or Registrar. The permit specifies the total units and authorized subjects. <br>

      from the Nurse on Duty in the UP Mindanao campus or from the proper medical
      offices in units outside UP Mindanao.

            However, faculty members may set longer attendance requirements as needed for their courses, provided they inform the students.

          If the majority of absences are excused, students receive a grade of DRP instead of a failing grade of 5.00. Conversely, if most absences are unexcused, a grade of 5.00 is given. Late enrollment time is considered as time lost due to absence.

  utter_leave_of_absence_policy:
  - text: "Students at the University of the Philippines can request a leave of absence by submitting a written petition to the Dean, stating the reason for the leave and specifying its duration. The leave typically should not exceed one year but may be renewed for up to another year. However, the aggregate leave of absence should not exceed two years if not utilized in two successive years. If a student needs a leave beyond this period, they may be advised to apply for an honorable dismissal without prejudice to readmission.

        In cases where a student withdraws after completing three-fourths of the total course hours and their class standing is below 3.0, instructors may submit grades of 5.0. Withdrawal from a college or school without formal leave of absence can result in curtailed or withdrawn registration privileges.

          The grade of INC is given to students who fail to take the final examination or complete other course requirements due to valid reasons like illness. Students with a passing class standing who fail to take the final exam receive a grade of 5.0.

#           2) A grade of 4.0 shall appear in the Official Transcript of Records. For the
